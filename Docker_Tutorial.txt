First, run:

    git pull git@github.com:tipei/DISSCO-2.0.2

This will sync you to the lastest version of DISSCO 2.0.2.
Next, run:

    xhost local:root

This will allow X11 windows to appear from the docker.
Then, run:

    echo xhost local:root >> ~/.xsession

This will execute every time you log in, so you only need to do it once.
You then need to build the docker by running:

    docker build . -t ubuntu_dissco_202 && docker run --name dissco_202 -v $HOME:$HOME -w $HOME -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --net=host -it ubuntu_dissco_202

The name of the docker will be "dissco_202".
Docker will automatically start. 
You can then build DISSCO 2.0.2 as usual.
If you want to exit docker just type in:

    exit

After you've built the docker you do not need to rebuild it again. 
You can re-open it any time you want by running the command:

    docker start dissco_202 -i
