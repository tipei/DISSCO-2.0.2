/**
 * An artificial reverberator class.
 * The Reverb class implements an artificial reverberator, built on the model
 * in Moore's "Elements of Computer Music" book.  That model, in turn, is
 * based on Schroder's and Moorer's work.  
 *
 * In order to use this class you need to do three things
 *   1. Create a reverb object using the parameters you want.  There are a few
 *      different constructors to choose from, depending on how much control
 *      you want to have (and thus, how much you want to be burdened with 
 *      details).
 *   2. Call a Sound, Track, or MultiTrack object's use_reverb method and pass
 *      in your Reverb object as the parameter
 *   3. Render the corresponding object and let reverb run (the sound, track,
 *      or multitrack will call Reverb::do_reverb for you once you call its
 *      use_reverb member to setup a reverb object)
 *
 * Note: Reverb relies on some filters with feedback and delay, thus the filters
 * are partially dependent on old data sent to Reverb.  In order to clear out
 * the history in these filters, call Reverb::Reset before reusing a Reverb
 * object
 *

  /** The default constructor.

  /** simple constructor.
   *
   * @param room_size this is constructed to give some reasonable results 
   *  when you input room_size values between 0.0 and 1.0.  I found some 
   *  parameter sets that I felt approximated various familiar rooms 
   *  (lincoln hall, MB 1201, great hall, a large stadium, etc), and mapped
   *  these into a room_size space of 0.0 to 1.0.  Then I used gnumeric 
   *  (spreadsheet for linux, like excel) to find a linear regression to 
   *  get all the parameters simply in terms of room_size.  Thus a value of
   *  0.0 will have virtually no reverb.  A value of 1.0 will have a very 
   *  high degree of reverb.
   * @param samplingRate the number of samples per second that the reverb 
   *   will assume on any data it is fed

  /** next-most-advanaced constructor.

   * @param reverbPercent this determines the mix (in the resultant sound)
   *  between the direct sound (the input sound) and the reverbed sound.
   *  0.0 is no reverb, all direct sound.  1.0 is all reverb, no direct
   *  sound.
   * @param hilow_spread in most rooms the low frequecy response will be higher
   *  than the high frequency response.  If we hold other parameters 
   *  constant, the math gives a range of possible ratios between low 
   *  frequence to high frequence response.  A value of 1.0 will choose 
   *  the maximum low-frequence response, holding the high-frequency
   *  response at a given.  A value of 0.0 will mean an even response
   *  across all frequencies.
   * @param gainAllPass Moore's reverberator has only one all-pass filter,
   *  and this is its gain.  The default value is 0.7.  Higher values
   *  (up to 1.0) cause more ringing at certain frequencies.  Lower
   *  values (down to 0.0) cause less ringing.  
   * @param delay this is the length (in seconds) of the first echo response.
   * @param samplingRate the number of samples per second that the reverb 
   *   will assume on any data it is fed
