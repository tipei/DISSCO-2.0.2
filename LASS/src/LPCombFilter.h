/**
 * This is a comb filter with a lowpass feedback element.
 * The comb filter class implements a comb filter with a lowpass feedback loop
 * as described on page 385 of 'Elements of Computer Music':
 *
 *  y(t) = x[t-D] + g * lowpass(x(t-D))<BR>
 *   where lowpass(s[t]) = s[t] + coef*lowpass(s[t-1])
 *
 *   Note that for stability, we must make sure that: -1 < g/(1 - coef) < +1
 * <PRE>

 * \note: This filter (and all other 'class Filter's) are stateful machines with

 * each time you begin a new channel and should not be mixed between channels.
